## Description

- This project is responsible for printing and marking voter QR code as ready.
- A random string will be printed on a QR code card, which the voters can use to verify and submit votes
- Assigner asks central system to generate this random text which doesn't link the voter to the printed QR code publicly,
- but the central system still has a record for later verification if users requests it.
- Create this project in Blazor framework.
- UI: Use Mudblazor or similar framework for UI components. 
- Add page to search voters, 
- fetch voter detail, 
- Print QR code then 
- provide option to print the QR code. 

- Keep verification from the central system as TODO task after we implement it in the Central system
